      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>China One Restaurant is located in the downtown area of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Covering only 1,500 square feet and with a capacity of around 20–30 customers, the humble setting is made intimate by traditional Chinese paintings, a television set to entertain waiting customers, and a dedication to service and food that makes the customer feel as if they are in their own home.</p>

      <p>The owner, Mr. Lin, and his wife launched this business eight years ago. Like many businesses just starting out, the Lin family encountered some challenges shortly after opening. Initially, people were reluctant to visit the new restaurant and the couple didn't spend any money on advertising. To attract customers, China One kept it simple and just stuck to the food.</p>

      <p>The chefs worked hard to offer stunning creations with mouthwatering color, aroma, flavor, and presentation. Currently, the thriving business of this small take-out restaurant can be attributed to “word of mouth” promotions made by exuberant return customers. Mr. Lin credits the business’s success not only to loyal customers but to his wife as well.</p>

      <p>“Sesame Chicken is always a crowd-pleaser,” says Mr. Lin. The crispy texture comes from chicken chunks pickled with super green starch, then mixed with starch and egg, and fried until golden. Finally, the chicken is fried with sauce and topped with sesame seeds.</p>

      <p>Another must-try dish is the Pan-Fried Prawns, cooked with capsicums and a special Hoisin-based sauce. Mr. Lin’s unique mix of soy sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, chicken essence, and garlic makes the flavor unforgettable.</p>

      <p>Despite the humble beginnings, Mr. Lin never compromised on quality, freshness, or price. Today, he employs three chefs and checks every dish himself. And when needed, he’s still happy to put on an apron and serve his customers personally.</p>

      <p>“My happiest moments,” Mr. Lin shares, “are when I receive thank-you cards and letters from customers. Reading them wipes out all the tiredness from a long day.”</p>
